**OVERVIEW**

In this application, you will explore a dataset from Kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing.  Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive.  As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.

### CRISP-DM Framework

To frame the task, throughout our practical applications, we will refer back to a standard process in industry for data projects called CRISP-DM.  This process provides a framework for working through a data problem.  Your first step in this application will be to read through a brief overview of CRISP-DM [here](https://mo-pcco.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/BH-PCMLAI/module_11/readings_starter.zip).  After reading the overview, answer the questions below.

### Business Understanding

From a business perspective, we are tasked with identifying key drivers for used car prices.  In the CRISP-DM overview, we are asked to convert this business framing to a data problem definition.  Using a few sentences, reframe the task as a data task with the appropriate technical vocabulary.

> As a used car dealership, it is important to us to understand what an appropriate market price is for the cars we sell. This dataset contains a large number of used cars with various details about them and how much they sold for. Using this large dataset, we can construct a theoretical model of how much each of these different details contributes to the market value of a car. This model can then, hopefully, be used to predict with decent precision the expected value of other cars that are not in the dataset and have not been sold yet. In doing so, the prices we set can be as attuned as possible to the details of the market, maximizing business profits.

### Data Understanding

After considering the business understanding, we want to get familiar with our data.  Write down some steps that you would take to get to know the dataset and identify any quality issues within.  Take time to get to know the dataset and explore what information it contains and how this could be used to inform your business understanding.
