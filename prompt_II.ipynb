The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing.  Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive.  As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car."

    "> As a used car dealership, it is important to us to understand what an appropriate market price is for the cars we sell. This dataset contains a large number of used cars with various details about them and how much they sold for. Using this large dataset, we can construct a theoretical model of how much each of these different details contributes to the market value of a car. This model can then, hopefully, be used to predict with decent precision the expected value of other cars that are not in the dataset and have not been sold yet. In doing so, the prices we set can be as attuned as possible to the details of the market, maximizing business profits."
